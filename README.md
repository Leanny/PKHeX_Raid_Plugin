# PKHeX_Raid_Plugin
Plugin for PKHeX to display all raids, as well as calculate a den seed based on EC, PID and IVs. 

# How To Use
## Installation
Download ``PKHeX_Raid_Plugin.dll`` and put it in the ``plugins/`` directory of PKHeX. If the directory does not exist, create a new one.

### Note
In order to use the efficient method for Seed Calculation, Z3 is required (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases). Download the latest release for your OS, place ``Microsoft.Z3.dll`` and ``libz3.dll`` in the same folder as ``PKHeX.exe``.

### About Crystal Tower 
The Crystal Tower Den (ID 17) is a special den that can only be activated with an item. So far it has not been figured out how to identify the species inside the den, which is why the Plugin defaults to Larvitar. Also, it is not known how to advance the frame of this den except for catching the PokÃ©mon and then using new crystal.

### Common Problems
Please make sure that all DLLs used are unblocked (Properties -> Unblock) and that you use the latest PKHeX version.

## Useage
Open PKHeX, load a savegame, and go to Tool -> Display Raids. You will see the content of every currently active den, including the IVs. Clicking on ``Raid Calculator`` will show you the details for this den when you "reload" it as well as other interesting information.

# How To "Reload" A Den
Talk to the Den, click on "Invite Others", then advance the time of your Switch by at least 1 day and then go back into the game. Cancel the raid search and talk to the den again. This advances the den by 1 frame. It is not possible to advance frames by more than 1, so you have to repeat this process.
